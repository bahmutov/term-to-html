> Stream terminal output with ansi codes into nicely formatted HTML

Imagine you have terminal output, let's say from a test runner. It looks like this

![terminal output](images/term.png)

You can pipe the output through `term-to-html` to create equivalent HTML file. Same output (HTML page was white background)

![html](images/html.png)

The output could be used to do [visual testing against CLI output](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/visual-diffing-for-CLI-apps/)

## Use

```shell
npm i -g term-to-html
mocha spec.js --reporter spec | term-to-html > mocha.html
```

**Note:** many applications detect non-interactive terminal and turn off colors. Usually you can enable colors using an environment variable, like `FORCE_COLOR=2` in [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) library.

### Dark theme

You can output HTML page with dark background using `--theme dark` CLI argument

```shell
<my program> | term-to-html --theme dark
```

### Use as a module

```js
const termToHtml = require('term-to-html')
const html = termToHtml.strings(stringWithAnsi, termToHtml.themes.dark.name)
```

## Testing

There are [E2E tests](e2e.js) and you can observe the output by running

```shell
FORCE_COLOR=2 npx mocha spec.js --reporter spec | ./bin/term-to-html.js
```

### Small print
